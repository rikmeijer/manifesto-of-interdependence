**Manifesto of Interdependence**

In society, there is a continuous friction between the interests of the individual and the interests of the collective. The individual seeks self-expression; the collective seeks continuity. In our current system, these are represented by neo-liberal, "right-wing" thinking for the individual and socialist, "left-wing" thinking for the collective. These are presented as opposites, yet neither can exist without the other. The individual perishes without the collective; there is no collective without individuals. Although they seem to exist separately, they are two sides of the same coin.

I believe there is a way out of polarization when we acknowledge that we are mutually dependent on the other for our existence (in the broadest sense of the word). This also means that both opposing poles must recognize that their vision is not the absolute truth but, on the contrary, an understanding that is relative to the understanding of the other. As long as we fight the other, we are essentially fighting ourselves. If the other dies, we die as well, for who are we without the other?

I have no guiding principles, for this is a search we should do together, without laying our rules upon the other.
